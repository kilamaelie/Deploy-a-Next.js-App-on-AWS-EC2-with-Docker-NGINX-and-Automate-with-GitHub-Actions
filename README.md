Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes. Deploying a Next.js app on an AWS EC2 instance allows for better control and customization of the hosting environment. 

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Next.js application on AWS EC2 using Docker and NGINX while automating deployment with GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

---

Before following this Next.js tutorial, we recommend that you first consult [Build and Deploy a ReactJS App to AWS EC2 with Docker, NGINX, and Automate with GitHub Actions](https://medium.com/@kilamaelie/build-and-deploy-a-reactjs-app-to-aws-ec2-with-docker-nginx-and-automate-with-github-actions-d8c57fb47967). This guide is a continuation of the series on React deployment, focusing solely on Next.js-specific updates. The basic steps remain the same, and you can refer to the previous article for more details.

Remember, while these requirements are essentials, you donâ€™t need to be an expert in every area. You can learn and develop your expertise as you go along. Whatâ€™s more, official documentation, online tutorials and communities can provide invaluable support as you learn.

Let's get started on our journey.ðŸš€
